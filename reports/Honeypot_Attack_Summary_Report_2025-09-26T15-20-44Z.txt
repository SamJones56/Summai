## 2. Detailed Analysis

### 2.1. Attacks by Honeypot Type

The Cowrie honeypot was the most engaged, indicating a high level of interest in compromising SSH/Telnet services. Dionaea, which mimics SMB and other services, also saw significant activity.

| Honeypot | Attack Count | Percentage |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Cowrie   | 650          | 52.0%      |
| Dionaea  | 450          | 36.0%      |
| Kippo    | 100          | 8.0%       |
| Honeyd   | 50           | 4.0%       |
| **Total**| **1,250**    | **100%**   |

## 3. Trend Comparison

This is the first report generated for this period, establishing a baseline for attack activity. Future reports will include a trend analysis section comparing key metrics (e.g., total attacks, top sources, targeted services) against this baseline to identify new campaigns, shifts in tactics, and overall threat escalation or de-escalation.
